# tvlive
This data package allows you to watch live TV on your computer (Mainland China and Hong Kong).

Note: The following operations are performed on the computer

Enter the live source website, right click and save as txt format
Download the conversion tool included in this data package and unzip it

The tool used next is called TeleList. After selecting "Create list", import the txt live source that needs to be converted, then select the format, and click "Execute Create". The tool will generate a live source required by the user in the same directory.

Then open the download player in the data package to install the software. After installation, open the live broadcast source file just now with potplayer.

Some live sources may be invalid, forgive me.
